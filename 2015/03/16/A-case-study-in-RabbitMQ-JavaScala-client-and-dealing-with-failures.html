<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have worked with RabbitMQ for many projects. I have always used the <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/java-client.html">RabbitMQ client</a> as a means to interact with the RabbitMQ server (as a producer and consumer). One of the things that I always found challenging was how the client dealt with failures. First before I continute, I wanted to give some background on how the RabbitMQ client establishes a "connection" to the server. RabbitMQ client/server talk via a wire protocol called <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html">AMQP</a>. What is different about how RabbitMQ client/server "connection" versus a JDBC client connection to a database, is that the RabbitMQ "connection" has one level of indirection to the TCP connection that the client makes with the server. This level of indirection is represented by the channel. Per the AMQP standard, the channel allows clients to multiplex one TCP connection. Therefore it allows a client to create multiple "connections" using the same TCP connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The typical way publisher/consumer client is through something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala">val cf = new ConnectionFactory()
cf.setUri("amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672")
val conn = conn.newConnection
val channel = conn.createChannel
// declare exchanges, queues, bindings if needed
//...
//if producer
channel.publish(exchange, routingkey, props, message)
// if consumer
val consumer = new QueueingConsumer
channel.basicConsume(queueName, consumer)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now since we don&#8217;t want to create a TCP connection everytime a message is published or consumed, the connection and channel are usually created during an application startup and remains open until the application shuts down. So these TCP connections and channels are long-lived.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With that we can now try to examine the scenarios when the connection/channel fail between the application using the RabbitMQ client and RabbitMQ server. I believe there are two classes of failure that needs to be considered</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>server-initiated failures</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>These types of failures are generated as a result of the client not being able to reach the server. Examples of these include network issues, RabbitMQ server is down or RabbitMQ Server forces a connection/channel close</pre>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>client-initiated failures</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Client initiated failures are ones that are a result of actions of the client itself. For example, declaring the same queue twice but with different features (exclusive, durable, etc)</pre>
</div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In versions <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/releases/rabbitmq-java-client/v3.2.4/">3.2.4</a> and under of the RabbitMQ client, there was no facility for the client to automatically recover from any kind of failures out of the box. However in <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/releases/rabbitmq-java-client/v3.3.0/">3.3.0</a> and beyond, the RabbitMQ client introduced the concept of autorecovery of connections/channels during some failure scenarios. This autorecovery facility is available through the ConnectionFactory via the <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/releases/rabbitmq-java-client/v3.3.0/rabbitmq-java-client-javadoc-3.3.0/com/rabbitmq/client/ConnectionFactory.html#setAutomaticRecoveryEnabled(boolean)">setAutomaticRecoveryEnabled</a> method.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala">val connFactory = new ConnectionFactory
connFactory.setAutomaticRecoveryEnable(true)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/releases/rabbitmq-java-client/v3.3.0/">3.3.0</a>, it was
up to the application to deal with both types of failures. At any point during the runtime of the application, a server-initiated or client-initiated failure occurs then we had to create a new connection, channel and reestablish the exchanges, queues, bindings. So a minor blip in the network or misdeclared queue would cause our publishers/consumers to fail since the connection/channel was closed. This was actually posed as a question by a friend in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19695897/how-do-you-handle-recovering-from-a-faulty-connection-using-rabbitmq-java-client">stackoverflow</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So now that we have the autorecovery facilities built into the RabbitMQ Java client, how does it actually behave when faced with server-initiated/client-intiated failures. Basically, if there was an error in the application logic using the RabbitMQ client, prior to 3.3, we were not able to reuse the channel. After 3.3, would the Java client recover and can we still use the channel. I don&#8217;t really feel that the section on <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html">Automatic Recovery</a> really explains this behavior in detail. So I came up with an experiment and recorded the results in the chart below. Scenario 1 looks at the behavior when autorecovery is set to false and there was a client-initiated error (i.e. redeclaring a queue, queue1, with different parameters) Scenario 2 looks at the behavior when automatic recover is set to true and there is a server-initiated failure (i.e. we shutdown then restart the RabbitMQ broker server). Scenario 3 and 4 are the same tests with autorecovery set to false. Channel Recovered column means that the channel was able to survive the failure and use it as if nothing happened. Connection Recoverd means that the connection survived the failure and use it as if nothing happened. Chan Shutdown Handler Called column specifies whether the channel shutdownListener was called. Conn Shutdown Handler Called column specifies that the connection shutdownListener was called. Chan hardError and Conn HardError specifies whether the error was a hard error. I&#8217;ve included the source code for each scenario below.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can see, it seems that when autorecovery is set and its server-initiated failure (i.e. lost connection to RabbitMQ server) then channel/connection is still useable once the failure has been addressed (connection was re-established to the RabbitMQ server). Regardless of whether autorecovery is set or not, if there is a client initiated failure, we are not able to reuse the same channel. So it seems the developer using the RabbitMQ client no longer needs to worry about flaky networks to the RabbitMQ server (of course still considering aspects of his environment and proper client configuration i.e heartbeat, network recovery interval). He can focus primarily on application logic.</p>
